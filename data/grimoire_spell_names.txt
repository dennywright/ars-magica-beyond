R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Group, Ritual Req: Intellego, Terram Special: Requires Boosted Magic or Mutantum Magic This spell creates a nearly perfect copy of the binding and every page of a book you are touching, including illumination, creases, and damages. It requires an Intellego requisite to determine the shape and size of the pages, and a Terram requisite to create the ink. While an effective method of quickly copying the contents of a book, the vis cost is generally considered prohibitive; Milvi instead use it to recover valuable books that have been stolen or lost, or to copy ancient works that are too fragile to move. Thus, this version of the spell also allows for vis boosting, so that you can accommodate an Arcane Connection to the book without requiring you to learn another spell.

ICARUS’ FOLLY MuAn 40 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind The targeted animal is given a pair of wings. It does not immediately know how to fly, but just like a fledging bird it succeeds after the first few attempts. Unfortunately, a flaw introduced in the experimental process makes the duration of this spell unreliable; at the end of every hour of the duration, roll a simple die. If the result is equal or lower than the number of hours that have passed, the spell’s duration ends prematurely. After the precipitous death of the first few test subjects, Marcus named the spell after the legendary inventor of wings who himself plummeted to death after flying too close to the sun. As if in compensation for the flawed spell, the second season of invention resulted in a breakthrough.

A DAY’S WORTH OF WEAVING ReAn 10

A DAY’S WORTH OF SPINNING ReAn 10

R:Touch, D: Mom, T: Group One of the first spells taught to Petalichus by his mater, this spell cleans, cards, and spins a whole fleece, or a bale of cotton or flax, into thread in a matter of moments. If dye is available when the spell is cast, the thread can be dyed as the caster directs. A Herbam casting requisite is required for plant-based cloth. This is an Average task for a mundane spinner, so the caster must make a Perception + Finesse (precision) + stress die roll against an Ease Factor of 12 (Craft Ease Factor 9 + 3 for using Craft Magic).

R:Touch, D: Mom, T: Group This spell is exceptionally good at making simple cloth, but casters may find it difficult to create cloth of any great quality or highly patterned tapestries. The table below lists the base Ease Factors for weaving bolts of cloth in a single casting. Treat each bolt of cloth as being two paces in length by one pace wide. Successive castings can extend the current bolt of cloth rather than creating a new item. Members of Petalichus’ lineage have traditionally used this spell in practicing their Finesse.

A swarm of frogs spontaneously generates in a pool of water touched by the caster. A pool five paces across and two paces deep can produce one thousand frogs; for every ten-fold increase in volume, ten times as many frogs are produced up to a maximum of 20,000 (which is a mass of frogs equal to that of ten pigs). Likewise, a smaller pool produces fewer frogs: a pool one tenth the size produces a hundred frogs, and one that is a hundredth of the size (about one pace across and half a pace deep) spawns just 10 frogs. The water in the pool is not diminished by this spell.

SUMMON THE ELDRITCH BOND ReAn 35 R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Ind.

A fine preparation to a Wizard’s War, this spell commands a biting insect, such as a mosquito or flea, to bite a specific target and then return. A canny magus can then harvest the blood and its Arcane Connection from the insect. Of course, this needs to be cast fairly close to the target for the insect to have a chance of catching him. However, combining this spell with Pests of a Colossal Size greatly extends its effective range, as well as the intimidation factor. It does rather reduce its subtlety, however; a magus who would ignore a normal mosquito is unlikely to do the same for a giant one.

WIZARD’S FLOOD CrAq 35 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind, Ritual This ritual, when cast in a river, causes it to rapidly rise and burst its banks. This floods the terrain about half a mile from either bank, for a length of about 20 miles, to a depth of two paces. The area inundated depends on the local geography (cliffs, gorges and dams may direct the flow, for example). The flood waters are natural, cannot be resisted by Magic Resistance, and may take days to recede, evaporate, and drain. The flood drowns people and animals, ruins crops, and washes away most wooden structures (and ruins the lower level of stone ones). This ritual is Trajan’s master work. He is well known for it in the Rhine. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +7 size) Source: Hooks, 79

They are not a perfect solution to water shortage, because Alexander, while young, cannot dispel this effect, so the water only becomes available when the spell expires. If forced to use his emergency water, Alexander prefers to first create a sanctuary using A Place of Recuperation and A Time for Slumber, then ration his water by keeping his servants, and himself, in diminutive animal forms until the Bag of Teeth reverts to gallons of water Each tooth may become just under a hundred cubic feet of water. This means that the teeth destroy any closed container they are stored within when they change back. They are able to cause explosions, but Alexander has never considered their military potential.

NEPTUNE’S WRATH ReAq 40 R: Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind, Ritual A gigantic wave is created in a very large body of water. The wave, which is only 20 feet high but up to a mile wide, is capable of capsizing ships at sea, smashing and drowning people near shore, and seriously damaging coastline communities. The tidal wave needs 5 miles of water surface to build itself up to proper proportions. The magus cannot control the wave without casting another spell.

THE STRENGTHENING TIDE ReAq 40 R: Touch, D: Moon, T: Part

TOWER OF LAVA ReAq 50 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Part, Ritual This spell sculpts a tower out of hot bubbling lava. The resulting tower is solid and rigid, but if its foundations remain in lava, then the tower will dissolve back into the bulk within a day. The Part target is required, because the spell does not use all the available lava. The tower is about the same size and dimensions as the one created by the spell Conjuring the Mystic Tower (see Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 153). A Finesse roll against an Ease Factor of 15 is required to ensure that the tower is well made; failure means that the lava takes a solid but malformed shape.

AIR’S GHOSTLY FORM CrAu 5 R: Touch, D: Diam, T: Ind

CHARGE OF THE ANGRY WINDS CrAu 15 R: Voice, D: Conc, T: Ind

A wall of wind roars away from you, starting up to 10 paces away and continuing until it dissipates naturally. The wind is confined by any existing barriers, but if unconfined it can be up to a hundred paces wide. All within the area must make a Dexterity + Size stress roll of 9+ or fall down and be blown along by the winds. The rolls must be made at the start of the gale and each subsequent round that the wind is maintained. You must concentrate on the gale. Missile fire into or out of the gale is futile, and marching against the gale requires a Strength + Size stress roll of 15+. Failure in this attempt mandates another Dexterity + Size stress roll of 12+ to keep from falling.

BREEZE FROM WITHIN CrAu 20 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind

A very minor breeze is generated in the nose of the target, allowing him access to all of the air that he requires for breathing. While underwater, the target of this spell exhales a constant stream of bubbles that cannot be stopped by the target for more than a second by holding their mouth and nose closed. The breeze cannot be halted without the spell being dispelled or expiring. The breeze makes the manipulation of especially small and light objects by the target difficult.

SCENT OF ASH InAu 15 R: Per, D: Conc, T: Smell The caster can smell and identify, on the breath of the air, the ash that has carried from volcanoes. This is enough information for the caster to determine the approximate direction and distance to each of the volcanoes he detects. A dormant volcano can be detected in this way from within one league (three miles), a volcano that has erupted within the last 100 years can be detected from within seven leagues (21 miles), and a volcano that has erupted in the last season can be detected from within 100 miles. Dormant volcanoes are detectable in this way because ash from their violent eruption is still present in the environment. The ash may have fallen to the ground, but some small (but detectable via Hermetic magic) fraction has been blown up into the air again.

People under cover are not affected. The stones revert to water when the spell expires. If it stops raining before the spell ends, no more rain is transformed, even if a different rain storm starts.

FOG OF CONFUSION Mu(Re)Au(Im) 45 R: Touch, D: Year, T: Bound, Ritual Req: Rego, Imaginem Turns a bank of fog up to six miles across into a silvery mist too thick to see through. Random screams, thumps, hisses, and other noises harass and confuse anyone within the fog, perhaps even leading them into danger. People have extreme difficulty navigating through the fog, especially through unknown territory. No more than seven people, who must be present at the ritual, can see normally through the fog. The fog does not dissipate until the spell expires.

RAIN OF OIL MuAu(Aq) 50 R: Sight, D: Sun, T: Ind, Ritual Req: Aquam Turns rain into droplets of oil. The rain of oil continues as long as the storm does, drenching the landscape with flammable liquid. The oil will evaporate at a natural rate after the rain ceases. A Creo Ignem spell can ignite the storm so that the oil burns as it falls, but this requires a Group target large enough to catch all the raindrops. Lighting the oil after it has landed is much easier.

A limb that has been detached from the body can be reattached, but any decay that has occurred on the severed limb remains after the limb is reattached. After a day of decomposition, a limb is weak. After seven days, it is nearly useless and infects the character on whom it is replaced (Stamina stress roll of 6+ or take a Medium Wound). If it’s been severed for more than two weeks, the limb is completely useless.

If its chosen target decides not to attack the limb directly, he takes a –3 penalty to all rolls and 2 extra botch dice.

THE CHARIOT OF ZEUS MuCo(Au) 30

R: Per, D: Mom, T: Ind Req: Auram Transforms the caster into a thunderbolt (equivalent to an insubstantial object). In this form he can move literally at the speed of lightning to any location he can see. There must be an unobstructed path between the caster and his destination. Upon arrival the caster transforms back into his normal shape with a mighty crack of thunder. Anyone within 2 paces of his destination must make a Size stress roll against an Ease Factor of 6 to remain standing. The caster can choose the location of another person as his destination, in which case he inflicts +30 damage to that individual and arrives standing next to her. If he strikes a building he arrives on the roof, and the building must make a stress check (City & Guild, page 77) or take six damage levels; wooden buildings catch fire even if they survive.

THE SHADOW ON THE SAND MuCo(An) 30

R: Per, D: Sun, T: Ind Req: Animal The ability to take the shape of a vulture allows Alexander to forage for food, and travel swiftly over areas that do not interest him. Vultures have exceptionally keen eyesight, so he is able to observe distant events on the ground in this form. Vultures are also considered birds of ill-omen, and he has occasionally used this shape to unnerve mundanes. Alexander has a strand of vulture feathers that he uses as a physical prop to allow this spell to be canceled at will.

CLOAK OF FINS AND SCALES MuCo(An) 35

R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind Req: Animal The caster hangs a small cape of fish scales on the back of the target and the target transforms into a naturally occurring fish of the same approximate size as the original target. The target may choose to change back to human form at any time, but doing so ends the spell. Fish and other naturally aquatic creatures do not suffer any penalties due to pressure.

FORM OF THE AQUATIC PREDATOR MuCo(An) 35

R: Per, D: Sun, T: Ind Req: Animal The caster hangs a small cape of shark scales on his back and transforms into a large shark of size +2 as described in the accompanying sidebar (found in Legends of Hermes). The caster may choose to change back to human form at any time but doing so ends the spell. Fish and other naturally aquatic creatures do not suffer any penalties due to pressure.

SHAPE OF THE CREEPING IVY MuCo(He) 35

R: Per, D: Sun, T: Ind Req: Herbam You turn yourself into an ivy plant about 12 feet long or high. You can sense only the most basic things, such as night and day, strong winds, and things that can affect a plant. You can resume human form at will, but doing so ends the spell. While in ivy form, you do not heal any wounds or restore any Fatigue levels. The ivy leaf you use to let yourself change back determines the kind of ivy the target becomes, and you cannot cast the spell without the leaf.

STANCE OF THE PATIENT TREE MuCo(He) 35

R: Per, D: Sun, T: Ind Req: Herbam You turn yourself into a tree about 12 feet high, with a trunk about a foot thick. You can sense only the most basic things, such as night and day, strong winds, and things that can affect a tree. You can resume human form at will, but doing so ends the spell. While in tree form, you do not heal any wounds or restore any Fatigue levels. The tree branch you use to let yourself change back determines the kind of tree the target becomes, and you cannot cast the spell without the branch.

THE FROZEN WOMB MuCo 35

R: Touch, D: Year, T: Unborn Child, Ritual Special: Requires Fertility Ritual Magic Virtue This Ritual spell freezes the development of an unborn child for a year. The spell does not damage either the child or the mother — although the mother may be seriously inconvenienced by a delayed late-term pregnancy — but both mother and child gain Warping Points due to being under the influence of a constant, high-power mystical effect (see Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 167).

A PUNISHMENT FOR BRIGANDS MuCo(An) 40

R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Ind Req: Animal This spell transforms a human into a mouse. While in mouse form, the victim of this spell may be affected by Circle of Beast Warding, which prevents him or her from fleeing if cast swiftly enough. This allows the mouse to be gathered into a bag and transferred to a place of confinement, or casually destroyed.

CLOAK OF MIST MuCo(Au) 40

R: Per, D: Sun, T: Ind Req: Auram You turn yourself into a thick, cohesive mist of approximately human size. You can float through the air at walking speed and can see and hear what is going on around you. You can also seep through cracks, but cannot move through solid objects. You may return to human form at any time, but doing so ends the spell. As mist, you are subject to the forces of the wind. In order to cast this spell, you must inhale some mist, and you keep the mist in your “mouth” until you want to end the spell.

FORM OF THE ZEPHYR MuCo(Au) 40

R: Per, D: Sun, T: Ind Req: Auram Transforms the caster into a strong gale wind. She flies at 50 miles an hour, but can increase this speed to that of a violent storm wind — 75 miles per hour — by expending a Long Term Fatigue level. She can travel at this increased speed for no more than an hour without expending another Fatigue level. This ability to gust is intrinsic to the type of wind into which the caster turns, much as the Cloak of Mist (Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 131) allows the caster to seep through cracks like natural mist. Note that because this spell turns the caster into a gale wind, she cannot travel any more slowly than 50 miles an hour. A different spell (of the same level) is needed to turn into a more gentle wind. The caster inhales a gust of wind to cast this spell, and can end the spell and transform back into human form by letting this captured wind free. While in the form of a wind, she can attempt to bowl over any object her size or smaller; this requires making roll of Strength + Concentration + stress die against the target’s Stamina + stress die. The defender may add Athletics to their roll if they are braced for the attack. If the caster’s roll exceeds her opponent’s, then the target is knocked off his feet and flung backwards one foot for every point of the difference. As a violent storm wind, the target is instead flung three feet per point of the difference. Falling damage (Ars Magica Fifth Edition page 181) is inflicted on those knocked over; hitting an obstruction before the full distance flung back is reached counts as falling onto a hard surface (such as a wall) or a soft surface (such as a haystack). Knocking over inanimate objects has an Ease Factor of 9 + (3 x its Size).

SHAPE OF THE ANCIENT KITE MuCo(An) 40

R: Touch, D: Moon, T: Ind Req: Animal You transform the target into a hawk, kite, or other small raptor, and any books carried by the target or clothing made of animal products that the target is wearing are also transformed. The spell is harnessed and tethered, so that the target has control of the spell and can end the effect at will, returning easily to human form when necessary.

SHAPE OF THE SIREN MuCo(An) 40

R: Per, D: Sun, T: Part Req: Animal The caster’s body from the hips down is transformed into the tail of a large fish, keeping the same approximate size. The caster also develops gills on his throat allowing him to breathe water but inhibiting his ability to speak, imposing a –3 modifier on all rolls to communicate verbally and a –5 to spell casting totals, as if the character were speaking quietly. While in this form, the caster can move at full speed underwater and does not suffer any penalties due to pressure.

THE LURKER IN THE RUSHES MuCo(An) 40

R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind Req: Animal This spell transforms Alexander, or someone he touches, into a crocodile. Crocodiles are fearsome foes in combat around water, and the stealth of the crocodile makes grogs that have experience with the form into useful amphibious or aquatic scouts. Alexander has a crocodile skin dagger scabbard, which he uses to cancel the spell at will.

TRANSFORM TO WATER MuCo(Aq) 40

R: Per, D: Sun, T: Ind Req: Aquam You turn yourself into water, one pint for every pound of your weight. As water, you can hold yourself together unless someone makes an effort to separate part of you from the rest. You can roll slowly across the ground, but cannot move uphill. You can hear sounds, feel things that touch you, and can sense temperature. You can resume human form at will, but doing so ends the spell. You cannot resume human form if a significant part of your body/water is separated from the rest. You pour a small amount of water into your hands when you cast the spell.

A SOURCE OF TREMENDOUS PRIDE MuCo(An) 45

R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Group Req: Animal Used to transform the covenant’s servants into a pride of lions. Medieval bestiaries recognize three varieties of lion. Male lions of the straight-maned type, which this spell produces, are lazier than female ones, and this has led to the formation of a small cadre of female warriors in the covenant, who are skilled in unarmed combat. A few carry bone weapons. Alexander sometimes uses a tail spur he carries in his trinket pouch as a physical prop to allow this spell to be canceled at will.

CURSE OF THE WEREWOLF MuCo(An, Me) 45

R: Touch, D: Year, T: Ind, Ritual Req: Animal, Mentem Over the course of a year, the target suffers from lycanthropy: the curse of the werewolf. With each full moon, the target transforms into the semblance of a wolf, losing both human body and mind to be replaced by lupine savagery. The effect goes beyond Hermetic understanding through the continued response to the moon without recourse to a device effect or linked trigger.

THE SILENT VIGIL MuCo(Te) 45

R: Per, D: Moon, T: Ind Req: Terram You can move into and become part of a rock formation that’s at least twice your size. While in the stone, you can hear what’s going on around you, but you can’t use other senses. The spell lasts until you come out, and you must come out where you went in. You have no need for food or drink, though you do age. Rolls to recover from Fatigue or wounds take twice as long to make while you are in the stone. Casting requisites are required for items you take with you into the stone.

A SPELL FOR THE DEFENSE OF THE REALM AGAINST EXPECTED INVASION

ALTERATION OF THE BIRTH HOROSCOPE MuCo(Vi) 55

R: Touch, D: Year, T: Ind, Ritual Req: Vim Using insight from the observations of three-score horoscopes, this spell masks the essential birth horoscope for the given target, altering the effects of the heavens upon the target. Horoscopes created for this individual fail unless calculated using new birth information defined during the ritual, including the place, date, and time of birth, among other factors. Effects that derive a horoscope from a magical understanding of the target function as normal, but any information gained relates to the altered birth information.

MISTS OF CHANGE MuCo(An) 60

R: Voice, D: Sun & Year, T: Bound, Ritual Req: Animal As this spell is cast, a whipping wind arises and patches of mist begin to roll across the landscape. Sometimes, a patch of mist suddenly envelops a person for a few seconds, during which time the victim cannot move. When the mist blows away, continuing its course, the person is left transformed into a random creature. Roll a simple die to determine the result:

DRAGON’S BLOOD Mu(Re)Co(Ig, Te) 70

R: Per, D: Year, T: Part, Ritual Req: Rego, Ignem, Terram This ritual changes the blood of the caster into lava. This does no harm to the caster himself, and his superheated blood means that he is immune to any heatbased damage that causes +15 or less damage (which includes lava).

COVENANT OF THE DRAGON Mu(Re)Co(Ig, Te) 85

R: Touch, D: Year, T: Group, Ritual Req: Rego, Ignem, Terram This ritual changes the blood of a Group of up to 100 individuals into lava. This has the same effect on each member of the Group as the ritual Dragon’s Blood. This is an efficient way (in terms of vis) of protecting an entire covenant from the heat hazards of living in a covenant located in a volcano — although each person will take 6 Warping points every year (see Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 168).

TRAP OF AMBER ReCo 15 R: Touch, D: Diam, T: Ind The caster freezes the target in place for the duration of the spell. As well as being unable to move, the target can neither speak nor use gestures in spell casting, and he takes the appropriate penalties if he does try to cast spells regardless.

R: Per, D: Sun, T: Ind Special: Requires Holy Magic The target’s body acts as if unwounded and unfatigued. Wound and fatigue penalties do not apply until the spell expires, and wounds may worsen but this will not be apparent until the spell ends, when accumulated Fatigue takes effect (and may leave the target unconscious). Consecutive castings delay the end of the spell, putting off the time until the accumulated wounds take effect — but the body can only take a number of consecutive castings equal to its Size + 2. Further castings have no effect.

HOLD CHUR ReCo 30 R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Ind Holds the target completely motionless for the duration of the spell. In addition, the spell closes the eyes of the target and keeps them firmly shut, so that he is unable to see for the duration of the spell.

He is transported with all his belongings and equipment, just as if transported by a Rego Corpus spell. He remains there until the dream he is in ends, he leaves by the portal he entered through, or he finds some means to escape by using a spell.

A huge net of thick threads grows in the indicated area, filling a space 5 paces by 5 paces by 6 feet high. With supports the nets can hang vertically, forming a wall, otherwise they act just like a fishing net. Everyone caught in the area is captured within the nets. Getting free requires a Strength stress roll against an Ease Factor of 9; or else someone who is not trapped may use an edged weapon to free a victim, which takes three rounds. Fire is exceptionally effective against the nets, but risks burning anyone caught within. The nets are not sticky, and cannot trap anyone who stumbles into them.

FAST GROW CrHe 30 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind This spell brings a plant to full maturity in a single day or night. Note that the spell must be cast soon after sunrise or sunset for the duration to be long enough for its effect.

RUNNING REPAIRS CrHe(Te) 30 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Str, Ritual Req: Terram This ritual repairs a single damage level to a vessel, represented by the magus identifying and targeting the damaged area of the ship. This ritual may be cast on a ship that has lost multiple damage levels, but only one of those levels will be repaired. A Terram requisite is required to mend or replace bolts, nails, and other fixtures.

CONJURATION OF BREAD CrHe 35 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Group, Ritual

THE BOUNTIFUL FEAST CrHe 35 R: Touch, D: Year, T: Special, Ritual

FORTRESS OF OAK Cr(Mu)He(Te) 40 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind, Ritual Req: Muto, Terram This ritual is normally cast on an acorn from an oak tree and it works like the spell Conjuring the Mystic Tower (Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 153) with the exception that it utilizes a tree rather than stone. The tree springs from the ground in moments, towering to its full height of around eighty feet. The tree is still alive, but it has chambers within, complete with earthen floors and earthen hearths for fires. The magus decides the shape and design of the chambers when casting the spell. If the tree dies, the tower remains, now being a dead tree.

RAZOR THORNS MuHe(Te) 25 R: Voice, D: Diam, T: Group Req: Terram This spell causes razor-sharp thorns to spring out of every plant or plant-made product in an area within the range of the caster’s voice. These thorns deal +10 damage to up to a standard group of people (up to ten). The thorns eventually retreat, but they remain for roughly two minutes and can still act as a viable deterrent as the thorns are still just as sharp as a knife.

BAG OF FEATHERS MuHe(An) 35

R: Touch, D: Moon, T: Group Req: Animal This spell is used to lessen the load carried by expeditions, by transforming all of the food supply they must carry, excepting that required during the spell’s duration, into feathers. In Alexander’s case each type of food becomes a different color and pattern of feather, so that servants who travel with him learn to read which feather is which provision. Food in feather form does not spoil, although it often tastes slightly of chicken after it regains its original form. Note that the food does not change back when the caster wishes; without Perdo Vim magic, he must wait for the duration to end.

LOCKED STOREHOUSE MuHe(Te) 45

R: Touch, D: Year +1, T: Str, Ritual, Faerie Req: Terram This spell changes a building and the building’s contents into a large rock of hard igneous stone for a year and a day. The rock is typically significantly smaller than the altered building (having approximately the same mass as the building), and is buried to the depth of the building’s foundation. If there is any material containing animal products in the building (such as leather or wool), then the spell must be cast with an Animal casting requisite or the spell will not function. Over the duration of the spell, the target building and its contents age normally but do not suffer decay in any other respect; Thus no mold or water damage affect the building’s contents, but foodstuffs that have been aged for a year and a day would still be far from appetizing.

AWAKEN CONSCIOUSNESS OF PLANT MuHe(Me) 55

R: Voice, D: Year, T: Group, Ritual Req: Mentem This spell works exactly as the spell, Stir the Slumbering Tree (Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 137), only it is used to awaken multiple plants at once rather than one or two at a time. Once raised, the plants have a state of consciousness that resembles that of a human. The plants can see and hear what’s going on around them and at a normal human level of perception. Such plants tend to share some mental attributes or personality traits with the caster. The plants can rearrange their leaves, stems, or branches over the course of several hours, though too slowly for people to observe the movement from second to second. The size bonus enables the spell to awaken an entire forest grove in one go.

CURSE OF THE HAUNTED FOREST Mu(Pe)He 60

R: Touch, D: Year, T: Group, Ritual Req: Perdo Turns a previously normal forest into a haunted and dangerous place. The trees become gnarled and hideous, and the imaginative can see menacing faces in them. The trees also become conscious and cruel; capable of sight, hearing, and limited movement. While they cannot uproot themselves, they can move their branches about, and can reach the ground in an hour or two. Only ill-tempered animals, such as boars and crows, live in these woods, and nothing in them is edible. The only knowledge of what might happen should this ritual be attempted in a faerie forest comes from ancient and disputed legends of the Order of Hermes.

The magi must specify the shape of the plant when he casts the spell. The magus cannot increase the size of the plant, nor kill a plant by over-pruning it with this spell, but he can remove or rearrange the branches and leaves in any way that he likes, just as if he where pruning it normally.

It does not aid growth, or otherwise invigorate the crop. The selected base level of effect must be greater than the Might of the source of the magical plant disease, or of the disease itself if the disease has a Might score. In addition to the base effect level, the spell needs to penetrate the Magic Resistance of the magical plant disease, or more likely its source.

The trees do not uproot themselves, but they do bend in unnatural ways to help the magus reach them and walk unhindered from branch to branch. Of course, the trees’ branches still need to be strong enough to support the magus’ weight.

THE UNSEEN SHIPWRIGHT ReHe(Te) 30 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Group

A Perception + Finesse roll is required against an Ease Factor set by the storyguide. The table on Covenants, page 49, is a useful guide, but a rule of thumb is that repairing a small leak or a splintered rudder is a task of average difficulty taking no more than a day for an Ease Factor of 12, while refloating a wrecked ship is almost impossible, with an Ease Factor of at least 27 (plus any modifiers that the storyguide imposes based on how long it might take a mundane shipwright to refloat the vessel).

VESSEL OF THE CLOUDS ReHe 30 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind

A boat made of metal (or other metal object) could be made to fly using the Rego Terram base guideline of 2, +2 to affect metal. Metal is even more rigid than wood, and can bear an extra 75 points of Load in addition to itself. As before, Size modifiers lift ten times as much metal and thus ten times as much Load. The extra magnitudes have been added to this spell by analogy with the Rego Corpus guidelines.

ENDURING FLAME MuIg 10 R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind

A fire targeted by this spell is inextinguishable by wind or water for the spell’s duration. A fire will still burn out if it runs out of fuel while under the effect of the spell, and a candle that is the target of this spell may still be extinguished by being pinched or snuffed out. This spell was originally designed to keep a candle burning on a windy and rainy night, but it can be used on fires that are much larger in size and can even be used to allow a burning torch to be brought underwater without being extinguished. The bubbles, smoke, and turbulence caused by submerging a fire that is under the effect of this spell prevent it from being a useful method of illuminating aquatic areas.

SHOW OF THE FLAMES AND SMOKE MuIg 10 R: Voice, D: Conc, T: Ind

HORNET FIRE Mu(Re)Ig 10 R: Voice, D: Conc, T: Ind Req: Rego Turns a fire into a swarm of fireballs, each the size of a large insect, that fly and harass at your command. Their burning touch gives all those you indicate within 7 paces of the fire both a –3 penalty on all rolls and two extra botch dice, but they do not cause actual damage.

BOREAL FLAMES Mu(Pe)Ig 15 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind Req: Perdo This spell momentarily alters a fire so that rather than radiating heat, it radiates an icy cold. The colors of the target fire change from oranges and yellows to violets and blues. Any fire affected by this spell does cold damage rather than heat damage for the moment of the spell’s duration. Boreal Flames does not function on fires that are so hot that they do more than +15 damage. This spell was specifically designed to alter a casting of Pilum of Fire. Boreal Flames may be cast in conjunction with another spell; to do so the caster must make an Intelligence + Concentration roll against an Ease Factor of 15 (per Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 82). Ranulf uses Boreal Flames in conjunction with The Patient Spell, as doing so eliminates the need for such a formidable feat of concentration.

A Finesse Stress roll (Mastery of the spell reduces this to a simple roll) determines how pleasant the sound is, but the size of the fire determines how loud it is.

CONFLAGRATIOUS LANYARD MuIg(An) 30

R: Touch, D: Moon, T: Ind Req: Animal This is a spell Alexander designed to avenge a personal slight. This spell transforms a large campfire into a bootlace, glove, thong, lanyard, belt, or similar leather product, for Moon Duration. When the spell’s duration expires, the campfire continues burning as a natural fire, if it has sufficient fuel and air. A person wearing the item suffers +5 Damage in the first round, and in each subsequent round provided the fire has sufficient fuel to continue burning. Alexander appears to have used this spell to burn all of his rival’s favorite clothes, by incinerating the contents of a closet. Rumors that the rival’s ship was lost at sea with all hands have never been proven.

SUBLIMATION OF FLAME MuIg(Au) 30

R: Voice, D: Diam, T: Ind Req: Auram This spell changes a fire elemental (or another creature made of fire) into air for a short period of time. This renders the fire elemental incapable of using many of its powers for the duration of the spell.

R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Ind Req: Terram This spell turns the heat and flames of a large campfire into a small, very hard object, such as a gem or a piece of metal. If the object is broken the flame returns, but it dies if there is nothing to burn. While the spell lasts, the object is constantly emitting heat equal to a warm summer’s day; this heat warms everything within a few paces.

FLAMES OF SCULPTED ICE MuIg(Aq) 35

R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Ind Req: Aquam Turns a fire up to the size of a small house into ice. The ice forms beautiful sculptures of leaping flame, until it begins to melt. When the ice has melted halfway, the flames start again, but probably won’t spread, because of wet surroundings.

DOMAIN OF DARKNESS PeIg 45 R: Touch, D: Year, T: Bound, Ritual

A brief note on the specific use of this spell that should not to be mistaken for traits or side-effects of the spell itself: The area affected by Domain of Darkness provides a haven for all creatures that shun the light. It represents Tolides’ latest attempt to establish some sort of abode in a domain of his own. Because the affected Boundary is inhabited by a practicing diabolist, and the ritual needed to cast the spell is often powered by Infernal vis, the aura of the Boundary slowly but steadily accumulates more and more traits of Infernal Warping. For example, animals that stay inside the domain for an extended period of time are likely to turn into Corrupted Beasts — repellent aberrations of nature (Realms of Power: The Infernal, page 77). One day, the affected Boundary might even become a regio of its own, which is exactly what Tolides has planned.

FALSE WINDOW CrIm 5 R: Touch, D: Sun (some versions use Ring), T: Ind This spell allows the magus to trace the frame of a door or window and create a miniature that seems to show something that lies beyond the frame. A Perception + Finesse roll is required to craft a convincing illusion. The Ease Factor is 9 if the image seems to show a room, 12 if it seems to show a structure, or 15 if it seems to run to the horizon. These numbers already include the reduction for limiting the viewer’s line of sight, but could be reduced or increased by familiarity with the depicted scene.

AGER BELLI Cr(Re)Im 10 R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Ind Req: Rego This illusion creates a Roman soldier. The soldier responds to the mental direction of the caster, who must maintain concentration as the soldier moves. The image contains only visual elements. This spell is used by Hermetic apprentices to play Bellum. Note that other spells can be designed that make different illusionary images. A Roman soldier is a standard image, but any Size 0 figure is allowed, including knights, club-wielding barbarians, and supernatural creatures like fauns and satyrs.

FOOLING THE EYE CrIm 10 R: Sight, D: Mom, T: Part

A magus using this spell creates the correct species for the swift movement of a small bright object, and casts them at the head of the target. Virtually all humans have in involuntary reflex that makes their eyes track the paths of moving objects, particularly those that might strike them. The magus uses this reflex against the victim, because when she looks where the object should be, she makes eye contact with the magus. This allows the magus to cast spells with Eye Range on the victim.

PHANTASM OF THE TALKING HEAD CrIm 10 R: Voice, D: Diam, T: Ind

SILENT SHOUT CrIm 10 R: Sight, D: Mom, T: Part This spell creates a burst of species, matching the caster’s voice, which strike the target in the head. This spell requires a Perception + Finesse roll against an Ease Factor of 6 to make the voice sound convincingly like that of the magus (the base Ease Factor is 9, with a –3 modifier for deep familiarity), but even if the roll fails, the target still hears the message. This spell is used on battlefields, or to instruct apprentices in the Tribunal chamber. It takes advantage of the directional nature of miniatures to prevent others from overhearing its contents.

AN ENEMY AWASH IN THE PURE SIGIL OF THE MAGUS CrIm 15

R: Sight, D: Conc, T: Part This spell washes the target with concentrated visible species, overloading the eyes. It requires no Finesse roll, because the species do not construct an image. In this case, the sheer number of species is being used to overload the capacity of the eye, so that the target is unable to see anything else. The spell’s name comes from its appearance, which is always based strongly on the sigil of the caster. The victim’s eyes recover two minutes after the spell is complete, or in only a round if the victim thinks to close his overburdened eyes when first struck by the spell.

The spell can only be used by a spiritual traveler; since he is in dream, the spell can in fact be a spontaneous ritual — but it must use real-world vis, either on the caster’s body, accessible through the Arcane Connection from dreamer to body, or brought in by a physical traveler.

A copy of the object given substance appears by the side of the entranced body of the magus casting this ritual.

CIRCLE OF UNDISTURBED REST Pe(Re)Im 25

R: Touch, D: Ring, T: Circle Req: Rego Created in conjunction with Be Rid the Tell Tale Smoke, this large circle spell is meant to be used around an encampment. The circle prevents iconic and echoic species from leaving the circle, making the encampment undetectable. Perfect for ensuring privacy in unfamiliar territories, it does leave the camp as a silent black area; this is normally enough at night, when everything is dark, and Conscientia does not see the need for additional illusions.

BY HIS WORKS CrMe 5 R: Per, D: Conc, T: Ind Refreshes a specific memory within the mind of the caster; as long as some fragment of it remains, this spell will restore it. Once refreshed, the caster can hold the perfected memory as long he concentrates. Studying the memory effectively creates a new one which does not fade when the spell expires. This spell was created to allow Quaesitors to perfectly recall spell sigils they encounter. The spell can be used to recall other details of a brief event, like faces or voices. This spell is often used to double- check identification. (Base 4, +1 Concentration) Source: Houses of Hermes – True Lineages, 73

LOOK AT ME CrMe 15 R: Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind This spell creates a thought in the imagination of the target, causing him to look directly at the caster even if the caster has not been previously noticed by the target. This glance is sufficient to make eye contact. If concentrating on another task, the target may make a Stamina + Concentration roll against an Ease Factor of 6 to resist. This spell is most often cast with no voice or gestures as a subtle way of attracting someone’s attention.

In most cases this is even enough to prompt enemies to come to her defense. Those under the spell must make a Personality Check against Ease Factor 9 to take any detrimental action against Lucia. Her Venus’ Blessing Virtue provides a –3 penalty to any such rolls.

THE OB OF MOT CrMe 25 R: Veil, D: Conc, T: Group Special: Requires Canaanite Magic Virtue This spell allows those about the caster to speak with a specific person in the world of the dead — to them it appears that the caster is speaking with the voice of the dead person. The caster is effectively acting as a temporary container or vessel for the dead spirit, and botches of this spell might cause the caster to become possessed by a malevolent spirit.

If a speaker’s Magic Resistance blocks the enhanced sense, the caster is aware of it as an absence. Many Quaesitors develop a high level of mastery of this spell and use it with the Acute Sense ability to great effect.

OPINIONS OF THE MASSES InMe 35

R: Per, D: Conc, T: Hearing When this spell is cast, the magus chooses a specific question. For the duration of the spell, the caster will hear a voice answering this question from each mind that he comes in contact with. The thoughts of minds that have dwelled heavily on the magus’s question are perceived as clear voices, the thoughts of minds that have given the matter little thought are perceived as loud whispers. Minds that have never considered the issue (and minds that are protected by Magic Resistance that the spell failed to penetrate) do not make any sound at all. Lambert has on occasion, by use of this spell, heard the opinions of spirits and invisible creatures to which he would have otherwise have been oblivious.

THE PRIVATE SPEECH OF EROS AND PSYCHE In(Cr)Me 60

R: Adelphixis, D: Year, T: Ind, Ritual Req: Creo Special: Orphic Magic For one year after this spell is cast, the magos may, at will, speak mentally with the target, and vice versa. This communication is not impeded by distance, and may not be revoked by either party without somehow canceling the spell.

A Tytalus maga who had need of sending agents to areas where they might be subject to investigation by Mentem spells convinced Lambert’s mater to allow Lambert to study the Lab Text for this spell as an apprentice. Lambert then used the spell for the benefit of the Tytalus who compensated Lambert’s mater for the service. The vis cost of performing the ritual, and the rarity of people willing to trust a Gifted magus sufficiently to allow their memories to be altered, prevents this from being a frequently used tool.

The affected people think themselves to be in a large, comfortable, well-lit room sitting around a table sufficiently large to seat every member of the bloodline, rather than at their actual locations. Those affected by the spell perceive their relatives to be with them in this room. The room itself is heavily influenced by the caster’s wizard’s sigil.

R: Eye, D: Sun, T: Ind Req: Animal The target’s mind is made physical as a bird. This bird normally stays close to the target’s body, but need not. If the target has Magic Resistance, it protects both his body and mind, as normal. No matter how far it travels, the target’s mind controls his body, as well as the bird’s, as normal. In particular, it can see through both target also dies, as his mind has been killed. (Base 25, +1 Eye, +2 Sun) Source: Ars Magica Fifth Edition, 149

SWORDS OF SILVER AND MOONLIGHT MuMe(Te) 40

R: Eye, D: Sun, T: Ind Req: Terram This spell makes the metal accouterments of a ghost solid. Many ghosts are able to affect the world with a single, favored object, but this spell allows them to use their entire kit. Weapons that are a composite of wood and metal work normally for the ghost, but only the metal parts may strike a mortal. Hard-pressed Tremere magi sometimes cast this spell upon the ghosts of dead shield grogs. Eye contact must be made with the ghost.

The victim of this spell cannot recognize instances of the thing, although she is that aware such things exist. If confronted with a representative object, the victim cannot identify or use it. This spell does not destroy Abilities, so if the character is placed in a position where she uses an object without conscious monitoring, her Abilities return. This can be alarming for the spell’s target, since she cannot consciously use the tool to repeat her inadvertent actions.

MIND

THE

TIRELESS

R: Per, D:Sun, T: Ind This spell is designed for a magus to cast upon himself at the start of a day’s work in the laboratory. Andreas of House Bonisagus, frustrated at his constant lapses of concentration, and finding it difficult to maintain focus on his research, came up with this effect in an effort to make his work days more productive. The target of the spell finds his mind resolutely fixed on the task in hand, and does not waver from it. Opinion is sharply divided on the merits of this spell, with the majority of magi considering it little more than a dangerous self-delusion, which warps the mind of the magus, making him dependent and weak-willed. If this spell is used on a daily basis, a magus should select the Addled laboratory routine (see Covenants).

TRUST ME ReMe 20 R: Eye, D: Sun, T: Ind Occasionally a Quaesitor may need to question mundanes directly, typically grogs and companions. This spell can be used to make the process less effort and more productive. The effect simply creates a counter-balancing force on the subject’s mind. The Gift itself is not affected in any way, only the subject’s mind is. The spell is as powerful as Aura of Rightful Authority, but more subtle. The spell only acts to level the subject’s attitude to the caster, not make them obedient or unnaturally well-disposed. Since the affected person retains free will, this effect does not count as scrying. Questioning using Aura of Rightful Authority does count as scrying.

THE SHROUDED GLEN ReMe 40 R: Touch, D: Year, T: Bound, Ritual Enchants the Boundary in which the ritual is cast so that anyone moving through it is subtly diverted, effectively keeping some place within it from being discovered accidentally. Anyone not actively searching for the hidden place never finds it. Those actively searching can find the place by making a Perception stress roll of 12+ (allowed once per day). If the surrounding terrain is more difficult to search than the average forest, the Ease Factor increases. Likewise, the Ease Factor drops if the terrain is more open than a forest, and completely open terrain is unsuitable for this spell. Once a searcher spots the hidden place, the spell does not prevent approach. Those who are present for the ritual are unaffected by the spell. This spell mimics the properties of many faerie forests.

A spell used on ancient battlefields to call up the pagan dead. This spell grants control of the dead, but if ordered to directly oppose their reason for remaining on Earth, they occasionally break the magus’s control. Roman legionnaires asked to attack Rome, for example, might break control.

The target object may appear unchanged for now, but it has a reality that extends beyond dream, so that if a physical traveler leaves a dream bearing the object, it travels with him and appears in the real world. If the spell is cast without real-world vis, the object vanishes as it is brought into the real world. (Base 15, +1 Touch) Source: The Mysteries, 108

A copy of this spell resides at the Great Library of Durenmar, but it is infamous for causing inflationary troubles. Given the recent rulings in many Tribunals, a covenant of ten magi would only be permitted to distribute 20 pounds of such silver per year, so that it would take 30 years to exhaust the silver created by even a single casting of the spell. Therefore, while there is nothing to stop a magus from learning this spell in the Great Library, he would surely earn the instant suspicion and attention of the Quaesitores if he did so.

THE UNSEEN ARM ReTe 5 R: Voice, D: Conc, T: Ind As the spell listed in Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 155.

UNSEEN ARM ReTe 5 R: Voice, D: Conc, T: Ind Slowly moves a nonliving thing, like a mug, instrument, or small pouch of coins; it cannot oppose intentional resistance. Magi use this spell to manipulate things at a distance, but the spell cannot be used to pull something from a person’s hand or to move something that is held. Casting requisites of an appropriate Form for the target are required.

A traveler using this spell does not suffer undue delay for traveling over poor roads. Traveling at speed to cover more ground in the day still costs the stated Long-Term Fatigue level. City & Guild, page 85, provides more detail on travel speeds. Targets affected by this spell use speeds close to the top end of the applicable travel speeds.

FORAS VIM ReTe 15 R: Voice, D Mom, T: Group An easily fast-cast defense against other magi, this spell shoots a choking cloud of dust and gravel at its targets. Those within the cloud are blinded by the dust and grit, and find it difficult to breathe. Casting a spell while in the cloud requires a Stamina + Concentration roll against an Ease Factor of 12. This spell also has uses in detecting invisible opponents. Conscientia has been meaning to get around to mastering this spell so that she can fast cast it ever since she created it. Maybe next season ...

PERFECTION OF THE WELL-DESIGNED CHAMBER Re(Cr)Te(He) 20 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Str

A room so perfected counts for the Ceremonial bonus options of Hermetic Geometry. The magical perfection is momentary, and then slowly fades as the building structure decays naturally over time; for Ceremonial purposes most buildings remain perfected for a day or so before they settle slightly and lapse. The specified room becomes regular: right-angled with straight sides, or perfectly circular (most real buildings are not particularly straight). If this is not possible because the room is highly irregular, then the spell fails. If there is any doubt, a Perception + Artes Liberales (geometry) roll against an Ease Factor of 12 or higher resolves the issue. (Difficulty depends upon the irregularities that need perfecting, however, if the Ease Factor would be less than 12 (Hard) the spell will perfect the target without guidance.)

A SEASON’S INNING ReTe(Aq) 25 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Bound, Ritual Req: Aquam Some waterways, especially those near estuaries, are surrounded by marshland. However, there are techniques for building up and draining the land. This can take many seasons of work, with a large team of laborers working in very difficult conditions. The draining of marshland through the digging of drainage channels and the building of dykes is known as inning. This ritual allows the magus to drain an area 300 by 300 paces to the point that it is dry and stable, as though a season had been spent inning the land. The Aquam requisite is used to move the standing water outside the spell boundary, which makes the inning work easier than normal.

CRYSTAL RAIN ReTe 30 R: Sight, D: Mom, T: Group This spell causes a vast cloud of sharp shards of glass fly to a point in the sky, and then fall to the earth. From a distance, as the light refracts through the plunging glass, it looks like a curious sort of localized rain. The area covered by the falling glass is about 10 paces across, and anyone in (or passing through) the area takes +10 damage. If a wound is caused, blood from the victim falls onto the earth.

DENY THEM THE BRIDGE ReTe 30 R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Str

A Perception + Finesse Stress roll is required against a base Ease Factor of 9. Larger bridges, up to the maximum size manageable with this variant, increase the Ease Factor by +3. Failing the roll means one check for damage as per City & Guild, page 77, for each point by which the casting roll failed.

EARTH SHOCK ReTe 30 R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Part Shakes the ground in a 100 pace radius. All affected by this spell must make a Quickness – Encumbrance stress roll of 10+ or fall. Apply these modifiers: standing still, +2; on solid stone, +2; moving slowly, +0; on earth, +0; running, –2; standing on a narrow bridge, –6.

GLASS BROOM ReTe 30 R: Sight, D: Conc, T: Group This spell moves a lot of glass objects around. The spell can be used to move around glass created by The Shattered Goblet. It can also be used to move other glass around.

HERMES’ PORTAL ReTe 75 R: Arc, D: Year, T: Ind, Ritual Creates a magical portal through which people, animals, and objects can travel almost instantaneously. The ritual must be cast twice, simultaneously at two different locations, and after the rituals are performed, there is a magical connection between them. The magi conducting each ritual must have an Arcane Connection (such as a clod of dirt) to the other location when they are conducting the ritual. The portal is activated by some command word or ritual determined when the portal is enchanted. Inanimate things and unwilling creatures may be transmitted if someone else says the command word, and pushes the subject through.

R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Ind This spell creates a temporary Arcane Connection to a specific demon within range of the caster’s voice, allowing him to penetrate its Magic Resistance more easily with additional spells. This connection is intangible, a sort of conduit rather than a physical object, and so it cannot be fixed in the laboratory and does not itself convey any Penetration bonus. Thus, forcing a demon to teach the magus its True Name is even better.

ENDURANCE OF THE WITCH MOON Cr(Mu)Vi 35

R: Voice, D: Mom, T: Ind Req: Muto Similar to the common spell The Enigma’s Gift (Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 157), this spell causes the target to gain four Warping Points. However, in the case of characters with a specific response to Warping, the effect of these points is to force the target to undergo the Witch Moon just as if the affected target were a member of the Folk Witch hedge tradition, as described in Hedge Magic: Revised Edition, page 42. Enduring the Witch Moon is automatic. This replaces the normal effects of gaining two or more Warping Points, which for Hermetic magi is a roll for Twilight. This effect is inspired by observing the Witch Moon endured by a subject Folk Witch.

SUTURE GAIA’S WOUND CrVi(He) 45

R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Bound, Ritual Req: Herbam This spell repairs the damage done by the Great Pestilence to the aura and the Herbam Form in a specific area. It does not prevent future impairments from the sentient fungus.

CONSECRATION OF MERCURY’S HOUSE CrVi 55

R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Str, Ritual This momentary ritual opens a temple shell to habitation by Mercury. This creates a level 1 Magic aura within the temple precinct (which may be then swamped by a larger aura of a different sort). As this is a momentary Creo ritual, once the ritual has been cast the aura remains and cannot be dispelled. If the temple already has a Magic aura the existing aura is not increased by the casting of this spell.

THE GREAT DISCORD CrVi 55 R: Touch, D: Moon, T: Bound, Ritual The whole parish is tainted by magic, and for the spell duration everyone in the parish suffers from the social penalties of The Gift: husbands and wives bicker and feud, brawls erupt in the fields, and animals flee from their masters. The parish is paralyzed by the social breakdown, and by the end of the spell several parishioners may have been murdered. The parish immediately gains a reputation for being cursed, and it can take years for harmony to be restored. Also, as the parish animals have fled and the fields have been only erratically tended, it is likely that the parish will suffer from famine and starvation in the following year.

It then compares the angles between these lines, to provide a unique pair of numbers, representing the array. This is the Ptolemaic coordinate for the caster’s position, provided that the caster knows the array at origin. A magus is unable to hold coordinates in her mind with sufficient precision to represent a circle less than 1000 paces across. Notebooks or devices with coordinates in them allow greater precision.

THE WICKED JAR MuVi Gen R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Ind This spell changes a demon with Might no greater than (the level of this spell – 10) so that it is bound to a physical object, usually a hollowed jar or pot made of clay and sealed. The effect is similar to the Goetic Art of Binding: the demon becomes part of the object for as long as the spell is active, and is only released if the object is broken or the effect ends.

The enchantment is utterly destroyed, as is all of the vis that was used in the magic item. The object left is in all ways a mundane item, but could be invested with enchantments again at a later time.

If the spell penetrates the creature’s Magic Resistance, the creature loses Might equal to the spell’s level. A creature with zero Might is permanently destroyed. The creature must be sensed by the caster to be a valid target; the caster may have to employ other magic to perceive a spirit before using this spell.

A black tentacle, similar to a writhing whip, lashes out from the caster’s palm to hit the targeted Infernal creature, reducing its Infernal Might score by 10 points. Brought close to destruction, a demon can be punished, and forced to obey, or at least to take the caster seriously. Note that the caster must be able to perceive or sense a demon to target it, and the spell must penetrate its Magic Resistance to take effect.

ARCANE SEAL ReVi Gen R: Touch, D: Sun, T: Ind This spell can be cast on a magical tunnel created by an Intangible Tunnel-style of effect, but it may only be cast by the magus who originally cast the Intangible Tunnel effect, because this spell uses the “suppress own spell” guideline (see Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 161).

OPENING THE INTANGIBLE TUNNEL ReVi Gen R: Arc, D: Conc, T: Ind

A magus who magically recognizes the tunnel (through The Invisible Eye Revealed or a similar spell) may cast spells through the tunnel back at you, and he need not concentrate on keeping the tunnel open. If this magus is the target of the spell, he is considered to be touching you. Otherwise, his effective range to you is his range to the target of the tunneling spell.

THE CURSÈD DAY ReVi Gen R: Arc, D: Sun, T: Ind

THE EVIL EYE ReVi Gen R: Sight, D: Diam, T: Ind Sometimes a magus cannot acquire an Arcane Connection to his quarry. This spell opens a tunnel between the magus and any target within Sight Range. The advantage of this is that it lowers the effective range between the magus and the target — which means that lower magnitude effects can be used on the target, which should increase the effective Penetration Total. Effects cast through The Evil Eye tunnel can be up to one magnitude greater than the magnitude of The Evil Eye spell.
