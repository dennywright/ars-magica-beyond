WIZARD’S FLOOD CrAq 35 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind, Ritual This ritual, when cast in a river, causes it to rapidly rise and burst its banks. This floods the terrain about half a mile from either bank, for a length of about 20 miles, to a depth of two paces. The area inundated depends on the local geography (cliffs, gorges and dams may direct the flow, for example). The flood waters are natural, cannot be resisted by Magic Resistance, and may take days to recede, evaporate, and drain. The flood drowns people and animals, ruins crops, and washes away most wooden structures (and ruins the lower level of stone ones). This ritual is Trajan’s master work. He is well known for it in the Rhine. (Base 3, +1 Touch, +7 size) Source: Hooks, 79

BAG OF TEETH MuAq(An) 20 R: Touch, D: Moon, T: Ind Req: Animal Transforms a pool of water into an animal tooth. When on expedition, Alexander often carries several of these teeth. They are not a perfect solution to water shortage, because Alexander, while young, cannot dispel this effect, so the water only becomes available when the spell expires. If forced to use his emergency water, Alexander prefers to first create a sanctuary using A Place of Recuperation and A Time for Slumber, then ration his water by keeping his servants, and himself, in diminutive animal forms until the Bag of Teeth reverts to gallons of water Each tooth may become just under a hundred cubic feet of water. This means that the teeth destroy any closed container they are stored within when they change back. They are able to cause explosions, but Alexander has never considered their military potential.

The volume of lava moved is about 2 cubic feet, and it can be moved to hit any location within Voice range. Whatever the lava hits takes between +15 and +60 damage, depending on how much of it is covered by the lava. The lava sticks to whatever it hits and continues to inflict damage each round. It takes several days for the lava to cool naturally.

NEPTUNE’S WRATH ReAq 40 R: Sight, D: Mom, T: Ind, Ritual A gigantic wave is created in a very large body of water. The wave, which is only 20 feet high but up to a mile wide, is capable of capsizing ships at sea, smashing and drowning people near shore, and seriously damaging coastline communities. The tidal wave needs 5 miles of water surface to build itself up to proper proportions. The magus cannot control the wave without casting another spell.

TOWER OF LAVA ReAq 50 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Part, Ritual This spell sculpts a tower out of hot bubbling lava. The resulting tower is solid and rigid, but if its foundations remain in lava, then the tower will dissolve back into the bulk within a day. The Part target is required, because the spell does not use all the available lava. The tower is about the same size and dimensions as the one created by the spell Conjuring the Mystic Tower (see Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 153). A Finesse roll against an Ease Factor of 15 is required to ensure that the tower is well made; failure means that the lava takes a solid but malformed shape.

SCENT OF ASH InAu 15 R: Per, D: Conc, T: Smell The caster can smell and identify, on the breath of the air, the ash that has carried from volcanoes. This is enough information for the caster to determine the approximate direction and distance to each of the volcanoes he detects. A dormant volcano can be detected in this way from within one league (three miles), a volcano that has erupted within the last 100 years can be detected from within seven leagues (21 miles), and a volcano that has erupted in the last season can be detected from within 100 miles. Dormant volcanoes are detectable in this way because ash from their violent eruption is still present in the environment. The ash may have fallen to the ground, but some small (but detectable via Hermetic magic) fraction has been blown up into the air again.

FOG OF CONFUSION Mu(Re)Au(Im) 45 R: Touch, D: Year, T: Bound, Ritual Req: Rego, Imaginem Turns a bank of fog up to six miles across into a silvery mist too thick to see through. Random screams, thumps, hisses, and other noises harass and confuse anyone within the fog, perhaps even leading them into danger. People have extreme difficulty navigating through the fog, especially through unknown territory. No more than seven people, who must be present at the ritual, can see normally through the fog. The fog does not dissipate until the spell expires.

RAIN OF OIL MuAu(Aq) 50 R: Sight, D: Sun, T: Ind, Ritual Req: Aquam Turns rain into droplets of oil. The rain of oil continues as long as the storm does, drenching the landscape with flammable liquid. The oil will evaporate at a natural rate after the rain ceases. A Creo Ignem spell can ignite the storm so that the oil burns as it falls, but this requires a Group target large enough to catch all the raindrops. Lighting the oil after it has landed is much easier.

The trees do not uproot themselves, but they do bend in unnatural ways to help the magus reach them and walk unhindered from branch to branch. Of course, the trees’ branches still need to be strong enough to support the magus’ weight.

HORNET FIRE Mu(Re)Ig 10 R: Voice, D: Conc, T: Ind Req: Rego Turns a fire into a swarm of fireballs, each the size of a large insect, that fly and harass at your command. Their burning touch gives all those you indicate within 7 paces of the fire both a –3 penalty on all rolls and two extra botch dice, but they do not cause actual damage.

BOREAL FLAMES Mu(Pe)Ig 15 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind Req: Perdo This spell momentarily alters a fire so that rather than radiating heat, it radiates an icy cold. The colors of the target fire change from oranges and yellows to violets and blues. Any fire affected by this spell does cold damage rather than heat damage for the moment of the spell’s duration. Boreal Flames does not function on fires that are so hot that they do more than +15 damage. This spell was specifically designed to alter a casting of Pilum of Fire. Boreal Flames may be cast in conjunction with another spell; to do so the caster must make an Intelligence + Concentration roll against an Ease Factor of 15 (per Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 82). Ranulf uses Boreal Flames in conjunction with The Patient Spell, as doing so eliminates the need for such a formidable feat of concentration.

FALSE WINDOW CrIm 5 R: Touch, D: Sun (some versions use Ring), T: Ind This spell allows the magus to trace the frame of a door or window and create a miniature that seems to show something that lies beyond the frame. A Perception + Finesse roll is required to craft a convincing illusion. The Ease Factor is 9 if the image seems to show a room, 12 if it seems to show a structure, or 15 if it seems to run to the horizon. These numbers already include the reduction for limiting the viewer’s line of sight, but could be reduced or increased by familiarity with the depicted scene.

AGER BELLI Cr(Re)Im 10 R: Touch, D: Conc, T: Ind Req: Rego This illusion creates a Roman soldier. The soldier responds to the mental direction of the caster, who must maintain concentration as the soldier moves. The image contains only visual elements. This spell is used by Hermetic apprentices to play Bellum. Note that other spells can be designed that make different illusionary images. A Roman soldier is a standard image, but any Size 0 figure is allowed, including knights, club-wielding barbarians, and supernatural creatures like fauns and satyrs.

SILENT SHOUT CrIm 10 R: Sight, D: Mom, T: Part This spell creates a burst of species, matching the caster’s voice, which strike the target in the head. This spell requires a Perception + Finesse roll against an Ease Factor of 6 to make the voice sound convincingly like that of the magus (the base Ease Factor is 9, with a –3 modifier for deep familiarity), but even if the roll fails, the target still hears the message. This spell is used on battlefields, or to instruct apprentices in the Tribunal chamber. It takes advantage of the directional nature of miniatures to prevent others from overhearing its contents.

The real flame is not changed, so you won’t be burned by the parts of the image that extend outside of it, like the flaming breath of the dragon’s head.

OGRE’S STENCH MuIm 30 R: Voice, D: Sun, T: Group You change the targets’ smell (up to 100 people) in such a disgusting and awful way that they and every person near them must make Stamina rolls against an Ease Factor of 6 or act with a –3 penalty to all rolls. If they botch, they throw up.

SERVANT OF FIRE MuIm(Ig, Me) 45 R: Voice, D: Fire, T: Ind Req: Ignem, Mentem This Glamour spell (see page 101 in Houses of Hermes: Mystery Cults) turns a normal fire into a human servant. He has a simple intellect and is good for only simple tasks, but has no possibility of learning or free will. The servant must eat a lot of wood or other flammable materials, otherwise the fire will burn out, ending the spell. As long as the servant eats enough, however, the spell continues. This spell has a minor side effect from experimentation that makes the servant sing instead of speaking normally.

Once refreshed, the caster can hold the perfected memory as long he concentrates. Studying the memory effectively creates a new one which does not fade when the spell expires. This spell was created to allow Quaesitors to perfectly recall spell sigils they encounter. The spell can be used to recall other details of a brief event, like faces or voices. This spell is often used to double- check identification. (Base 4, +1 Concentration) Source: Houses of Hermes – True Lineages, 73

This glance is sufficient to make eye contact. If concentrating on another task, the target may make a Stamina + Concentration roll against an Ease Factor of 6 to resist. This spell is most often cast with no voice or gestures as a subtle way of attracting someone’s attention.

Her Venus’ Blessing Virtue provides a –3 penalty to any such rolls.

The caster is effectively acting as a temporary container or vessel for the dead spirit, and botches of this spell might cause the caster to become possessed by a malevolent spirit.

The victim of this spell cannot recognize instances of the thing, although she is that aware such things exist. If confronted with a representative object, the victim cannot identify or use it. This spell does not destroy Abilities, so if the character is placed in a position where she uses an object without conscious monitoring, her Abilities return. This can be alarming for the spell’s target, since she cannot consciously use the tool to repeat her inadvertent actions.

TRUST ME ReMe 20 R: Eye, D: Sun, T: Ind Occasionally a Quaesitor may need to question mundanes directly, typically grogs and companions. This spell can be used to make the process less effort and more productive. The effect simply creates a counter-balancing force on the subject’s mind. The Gift itself is not affected in any way, only the subject’s mind is. The spell is as powerful as Aura of Rightful Authority, but more subtle. The spell only acts to level the subject’s attitude to the caster, not make them obedient or unnaturally well-disposed. Since the affected person retains free will, this effect does not count as scrying. Questioning using Aura of Rightful Authority does count as scrying.

THE SHROUDED GLEN ReMe 40 R: Touch, D: Year, T: Bound, Ritual Enchants the Boundary in which the ritual is cast so that anyone moving through it is subtly diverted, effectively keeping some place within it from being discovered accidentally. Anyone not actively searching for the hidden place never finds it. Those actively searching can find the place by making a Perception stress roll of 12+ (allowed once per day). If the surrounding terrain is more difficult to search than the average forest, the Ease Factor increases. Likewise, the Ease Factor drops if the terrain is more open than a forest, and completely open terrain is unsuitable for this spell. Once a searcher spots the hidden place, the spell does not prevent approach. Those who are present for the ritual are unaffected by the spell. This spell mimics the properties of many faerie forests.

SUBSTANCE OVER FORM Cr(Mu)Te(Me) 20 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind, Mystery, Ritual Req: Muto, Mentem This spell can only be cast in a dream by a physical traveler and the caster must use real-world vis for the ritual. The target object may appear unchanged for now, but it has a reality that extends beyond dream, so that if a physical traveler leaves a dream bearing the object, it travels with him and appears in the real world. If the spell is cast without real-world vis, the object vanishes as it is brought into the real world. (Base 15, +1 Touch) Source: The Mysteries, 108

THE POET’S BUST ReTe 5 R: Touch, D: Mom, T: Ind This spell changes a block of stone into a carved bust. The caster must touch both the targeted stone block and the person who is the subject of the bust.

THE UNSEEN ARM ReTe 5 R: Voice, D: Conc, T: Ind As the spell listed in Ars Magica Fifth Edition, page 155.

UNSEEN ARM ReTe 5 R: Voice, D: Conc, T: Ind Slowly moves a nonliving thing, like a mug, instrument, or small pouch of coins; it cannot oppose intentional resistance. Magi use this spell to manipulate things at a distance, but the spell cannot be used to pull something from a person’s hand or to move something that is held. Casting requisites of an appropriate Form for the target are required.

FORAS VIM ReTe 15 R: Voice, D Mom, T: Group An easily fast-cast defense against other magi, this spell shoots a choking cloud of dust and gravel at its targets. Those within the cloud are blinded by the dust and grit, and find it difficult to breathe. Casting a spell while in the cloud requires a Stamina + Concentration roll against an Ease Factor of 12. This spell also has uses in detecting invisible opponents. Conscientia has been meaning to get around to mastering this spell so that she can fast cast it ever since she created it. Maybe next season ...

From a distance, as the light refracts through the plunging glass, it looks like a curious sort of localized rain. The area covered by the falling glass is about 10 paces across, and anyone in (or passing through) the area takes +10 damage. If a wound is caused, blood from the victim falls onto the earth.

The ritual must be cast twice, simultaneously at two different locations, and after the rituals are performed, there is a magical connection between them. The magi conducting each ritual must have an Arcane Connection (such as a clod of dirt) to the other location when they are conducting the ritual. The portal is activated by some command word or ritual determined when the portal is enchanted. Inanimate things and unwilling creatures may be transmitted if someone else says the command word, and pushes the subject through.

THE GREAT DISCORD CrVi 55 R: Touch, D: Moon, T: Bound, Ritual The whole parish is tainted by magic, and for the spell duration everyone in the parish suffers from the social penalties of The Gift: husbands and wives bicker and feud, brawls erupt in the fields, and animals flee from their masters. The parish is paralyzed by the social breakdown, and by the end of the spell several parishioners may have been murdered. The parish immediately gains a reputation for being cursed, and it can take years for harmony to be restored. Also, as the parish animals have fled and the fields have been only erratically tended, it is likely that the parish will suffer from famine and starvation in the following year.

The effect is similar to the Goetic Art of Binding: the demon becomes part of the object for as long as the spell is active, and is only released if the object is broken or the effect ends.

THE CURSÈD DAY ReVi Gen R: Arc, D: Sun, T: Ind

THE EVIL EYE ReVi Gen R: Sight, D: Diam, T: Ind Sometimes a magus cannot acquire an Arcane Connection to his quarry. This spell opens a tunnel between the magus and any target within Sight Range. The advantage of this is that it lowers the effective range between the magus and the target — which means that lower magnitude effects can be used on the target, which should increase the effective Penetration Total. Effects cast through The Evil Eye tunnel can be up to one magnitude greater than the magnitude of The Evil Eye spell.
