    description: >
      Creates 3,000 pounds of pearls, equivalent to over one million pearls about
      half an inch in diameter. These are remarkably large pearls, each one about
      a quarter of an ounce in weight. Good quality sea pearls usually sell for
      about three Mythic Pounds per ounce (Covenants, page 141). Each pearl is
      identical to its fellows, and is somehow marked by the sigil of the caster.
